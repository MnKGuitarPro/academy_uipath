# Exercise 002

## Practical Exercise

### Create a flowchart with the following properties:

* The robot picks a random number for us to guess, guided by simple hints.
* The robot should generate a random number and ask the user to guess it through an Input Dialog activity.
* The robot will indicate if the generated number is larger or smaller than the userâ€™s guess.

1. Build the guessing interaction by using a flowchart diagram
2. Build the guessing game by using a sequential layout
